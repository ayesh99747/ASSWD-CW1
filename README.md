# Introduction
This is the repository that contains the code for my Advanced Server Side Web Development coursework that was done during the final year of my undergraduate degree. In this coursework, we were required build a simple social networking website for people who like music. This project was done using the [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/) Framework and the main language used was PHP.
